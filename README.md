# SVM

Super Vector Machine goal is maximize marigin for having better classifier

![](./images/readme.png)

so we have and objective function and N(number of data) statements that have to satisfied

so we can  put statements in objective function :

![](./images/LP.png)

so we have to compute the derivative of Lp with respect to W and b and replace them in Lp to have Ld

after we have an optimizing problem and we can solve it by gradient descent, smo algorithm or even genetic
